This is the page I use to document all the laravel packages that I use as well as the different functionalities of Laravel itself, feel free to look at it, I'll always be learning something new so this won't go unnoticed, also I'll share the problems that I had with certain packages that might be abandoned already and I'll tell you how to fix them in case you run into the same one!
